# PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
I have added the completeDate property in our constructor for the goal blueprint and set its datatype to Date. We now need to update our Goals array to add a completion date to each goal.The Date instance takes 3 arguments the first one is the year, the second argument is the month the third argument is the date. The month is calculated from 0-11 where 0 is January and 11 is December.
